**MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**
This project implements a basic Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system using Angular and Node.js. The MFA system is verified using Google Authenticator.

**Technology Used**
Angular (HTML, CSS, TypeScript)
Node.js

**Project Details**
The project focuses on implementing a Multi-Factor Authentication system without the use of a database. Instead of storing data in a database, an array is used to store user registration information. The login page verifies the user's credentials by checking against the data stored in the array.

The main features of the project include:

1. Registration Page: Users can register by providing their information, including username, password, and secret key.
2. Login Page: Users can log in by entering their username, password, and Google Authenticator OTP (One-Time Password).
3. Google Authenticator: The project utilizes Google Authenticator for generating and verifying OTPs.
4. Data Storage: Instead of a database, user registration information is stored in an array.
5. MFA Verification: The system implements Multi-Factor Authentication, requiring users to provide both their password and the OTP generated by Google Authenticator for successful login.

**Getting Started**
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: **git clone https://github.com/suraj9083/mfa.git**
Navigate to the project directory: **cd mfa**
Install the dependencies: **npm install**
Start the Angular development server: **ng serve**
Open your browser and go to **http://localhost:4200/user/login** to access the application.
Please note that you might need to configure and provide your own Google Authenticator API key or credentials in the project for the OTP generation and verification to work properly.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic Multi-Factor Authentication system using Angular and Node.js. It utilizes Google Authenticator for generating and verifying OTPs and does not rely on a database for data storage. Instead, an array is used to store user registration information. This project serves as a starting point for further enhancements and customization to meet specific requirements.
